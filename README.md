# WhatsApp Forensic Analyzer 📱🔍

## Overview
The **WhatsApp Forensic Analyzer** is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze WhatsApp group chat data using techniques from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and forensic algorithms. This project aims to assist forensic analysts in conducting evidence-based studies of WhatsApp conversations by uncovering behavioral patterns and communication dynamics within groups.
This project is part of the research paper 'WhatsApp Forensic Analysis for Group Chats using Exploratory Data Analysis and Natural Language Processing,' presented at ICDSA-2024. The after-conference proceedings of ICDSA 2024 will be published in the SCOPUS Indexed Springer Book Series, 'Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems.'

```

## Usage 📝
1. Prepare your WhatsApp group chat export in `.txt` format.
2. Load the chat data into the Jupyter notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.
4. Explore the results and visualizations generated by the tool.

## Results 📊
The analysis generates various insights:
- **Message Statistics**: Top senders, average message lengths, and activity timelines.
- **Emoji Usage**: Identification of commonly used emojis indicating group sentiment.
- **Activity Patterns**: Analysis of member activity across different times of the day.
- **Word Cloud**: Visualization of the most frequent words used in the chat.

Refer to the figures and tables included in the notebook for detailed visualizations of the results.

## Conclusion 🏁
The WhatsApp Forensic Analyzer demonstrates the potential of using EDA and NLP techniques in forensic analysis of communication data. The insights gained can provide valuable information about user behavior and group dynamics.

## Future Work 🚀
Enhancements to the system may include:
