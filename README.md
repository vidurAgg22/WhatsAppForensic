# WhatsApp Forensic Analyzer 📱🔍

## Overview
The **WhatsApp Forensic Analyzer** is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze WhatsApp group chat data using techniques from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and forensic algorithms. This project aims to assist forensic analysts in conducting evidence-based studies of WhatsApp conversations by uncovering behavioral patterns and communication dynamics within groups.

This project is part of the research paper *'WhatsApp Forensic Analysis for Group Chats using Exploratory Data Analysis and Natural Language Processing,'* presented at **ICDSA-2024**. The after-conference proceedings of ICDSA 2024 will be published in the **SCOPUS Indexed Springer Book Series, 'Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems.'**

## Installation ⚙️
To get started with the WhatsApp Forensic Analyzer, clone the repository and install the necessary libraries.

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vidurAgg22/WhatsApp-Forensic-Analyzer.git
cd WhatsApp-Forensic-Analyzer
```

### Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 📝
1. Prepare your WhatsApp group chat export in `.txt` format.
2. Load the chat data into the Jupyter notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.
4. Explore the results and visualizations generated by the tool.

Alternatively, you can use **pre-existing sample chats** from `edited_chats.txt` present in the repository.

## Online Demo 🚀
A simplified version of the WhatsApp Forensic Analyzer is available online at: 🔗 **[whatsapp-chat-insight.streamlit.app](https://whatsapp-chat-insight.streamlit.app)**

### Steps to Upload a WhatsApp Chat File:
1. 📱 Open the WhatsApp chat you wish to analyze.
2. ⁉️ Tap the three dots in the top right corner.
3. ➕ Select **More**.
4. 📤 Choose **Export Chat**.
5. 📎 Select **Without Media**.
6. 📂 A **ZIP file** will be downloaded.
7. 📂 **Unzip the file** and upload the `.txt` file of the chat to the website to gain insights! 🔍✨

## Results 📊
The analysis generates various insights:
* **Message Statistics**: Top senders, average message lengths, and activity timelines.
* **Emoji Usage**: Identification of commonly used emojis indicating group sentiment.
* **Activity Patterns**: Analysis of member activity across different times of the day.
* **Word Cloud**: Visualization of the most frequent words used in the chat.

Refer to the figures and tables included in the notebook for detailed visualizations of the results.

## Conclusion 🏁
The WhatsApp Forensic Analyzer demonstrates the potential of using EDA and NLP techniques in forensic analysis of communication data. The insights gained can provide valuable information about user behavior and group dynamics.

## Future Work 🚀
Enhancements to the system may include:
* **Topic Modeling**: Identifying relevant topics from group conversations.
